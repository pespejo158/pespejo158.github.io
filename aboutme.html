    <body style="background-color:#73a5a5;">

  <p>Hi my name is Phalynn Espejo. I am a Senior here at Lawndale High school.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I love to draw and go to the mall. I also love to go to watch movies, 
    but my go to movie is always A Bronx Tale. 
      I also love spending time outdoors. I love taking my nephews to the park,
      I like going to the beach and camping.
      When I get older I want to eventually travel the world, but I especially want to visit
      all of the European Countries, Mexico, and Japan. 
      I also want to go backpacking in South America one day.</p>
    <p>This year I am planning on applying to a lot of universities out of state and a lot of HBCUs. 
    But I want to stay near home so I am also applying for 
        Cal State Chico or Cal State Channel Islands. I plan on majoring in Clinical Psychology or 
        in Crime Scene Investigation.</p>
